# docker-raspios-lite

Raspberry Pi OS Lite Docker images hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

## SetupÔºèInstallation

This project assumes that both
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/) and \[Buildx\] are
installed.

On macOS, you can install Docker Desktop (which includes Buildx) via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask docker-desktop
```

Once installed, launch **Docker Desktop** to complete the setup (accepting licenses and etc.),
before running builds.
